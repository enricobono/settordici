# settordici
Settordici is the fourseventeenth javascript framework this week. The next version will be released tomosterday. Stay tuned!

## Getting Started

Just include  `settordici.min.js` file in your html page, just before the `</body>` closing tag (performance matters).

That's all! You're ready to start your own business. settordici™ is automatically included in your projects. You don't need to include it with npm, bower, or in any other way.
